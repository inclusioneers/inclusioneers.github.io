On behalf of Inclusioneers, our heartfelt appreciation goes out to Greg Lawson.
As President of Beneficial Building Services, Greg worked with his management
team on behalf of Inclusioneers to support our inclusive mission that will
serve people of all abilities in Summit County, by sending a significant
donation. Greg and his companies support were accompanied by a note that
expressed that they were "happy to be a part of ...some amazing things in
Akron...in some small way". To the contrary, Greg. If there were more like you
and your company, with a heart for inclusion, we could accomplish our
Inclusioneers mission in a big way, to change the face of inclusion in our
community. Many thanks to you and yours. Please express our gratitude to your
company ~Mike
