We are pleased to announce that Bridgestone has added their grant support to
the Inclusioneers Lock 3 Inclusion HUB project. The first phase of the 3 year
Inclusion HUB project is a playground donated by Summit DD for relocation to
the downtown Akron area at Lock 3.  Bridgestone's donation was also accompanied
by their words of encouragement, for a continued partnership in 2018. Also,
they further commented that the Akron Trust Fund Committee in reviewing the
Inclusioneers proposal "were intrigued" by our "comments about engineering
solutions to persons with disabilities".  So, many thanks to our new partners
at Bridgestone who share our passion for inclusion. Together, we will impact
people of ALL abilities in Summit County. ~Mike
